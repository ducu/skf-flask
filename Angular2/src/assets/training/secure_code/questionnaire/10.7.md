# Answer

Select the true statement(s):

(!) Attackers cannot detect latency within an equality over a network.

(x) Where practical, you should minimize the time that normally-encrypted data is decrypted.

( ) If powerful “general-purpose” quantum computers are developed, they will render all encryption algorithms useless.
- No. Such computers will render useless common *public-key* algorithms that are popular in 2020. However, while they will halve the effective bit length of symmetric encryption algorithms, they will not render them useless; a 256-bit key for a symmetric encryption algorithm will effectively become a 128-bit key, which is still adequately secure for most purposes. In addition, new public-key algorithms are being developed that resist attacks from such quantum computers.
