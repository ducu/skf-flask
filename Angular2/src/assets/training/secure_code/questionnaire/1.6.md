# Answer

To develop secure software, simply add security tools into your continuous integration pipeline. True or False?

( ) True
(x) False

## Explanation

This is false, but it is a sneaky question because there is a grain of truth in it.

It is definitely important to have security tools in your continuous integration pipeline. No matter how good your design and implementation approach is, you will make mistakes, and tools in the continuous integration pipeline will help you find some of those mistakes.

But simply “adding security tools” is not enough. No tool can fix a bad design, and tools will miss implementation vulnerabilities. You must think about security no matter what you are doing during development and operations.
