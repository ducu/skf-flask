# Question

Select the true statement(s):

( ) In a secure one-way cryptographic hash algorithm, it should be infeasible, given one message, to create another message that has the same hash value

( ) SHA-1 no longer meets the full criteria for a one-way cryptographic hash function, so in general you should shift to another algorithm, such as the SHA-2 or SHA-3 family.

( ) A cryptographic hash function accepts an arbitrary amount of data and produces a value with a fixed length that represents the input data.

# Answer

Select the true statement(s):

(!x) In a secure one-way cryptographic hash algorithm, it should be infeasible, given one message, to create another message that has the same hash value
- This is true, this is “preimage resistance”

(x) SHA-1 no longer meets the full criteria for a one-way cryptographic hash function, so in general you should shift to another algorithm, such as the SHA-2 or SHA-3 family.

(x) A cryptographic hash function accepts an arbitrary amount of data and produces a value with a fixed length that represents the input data.
