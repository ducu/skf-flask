# Answer

To develop secure software you should always rigorously develop all the requirements, then develop your complete design, and only then begin implementing the software. True or False?

( ) True
(x) False

## Explanation

This is false. This is a “waterfall” approach and is generally a very risky way to develop software. You do need to have an idea of what you are trying to achieve, of course, but reality is more complex: as you design, implement, and field, you will get feedback into what the requirements really *should* be.
