# Question

Select the true statement(s):

( ) The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) supports 3 key sizes: 128, 192, or 256 bits.

( ) Triple-DES (3DES) is a secure encryption algorithm to use for large amounts of data.

( ) You should use the Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode of encryption algorithms, since that enables reproducibility.

( ) A common and generally good mode to choose is Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).

# Answer

Select the true statement(s):

(!x) The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) supports 3 key sizes: 128, 192, or 256 bits.

( ) Triple-DES (3DES) is a secure encryption algorithm to use for large amounts of data.
- This is incorrect. 3DES has an internal block size of only 64 bits, and that makes it vulnerable to a “birthday attack” if significant amounts of data are encrypted with the same key. 3DES is much better than DES by itself, since 3DES has a longer key size, but you should normally use something else like AES where you can.

( ) You should use the Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode of encryption algorithms, since that enables reproducibility.

(x) A common and generally good mode to choose is Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).
