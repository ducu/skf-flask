# Question

Select the true statement(s):

( ) You can eliminate all authentication security and privacy concerns by delegating authentication to another service.

( ) A secure way for a server to store passwords for inbound authentication is to hash the password using SHA-1.

( ) PBKDF2 is more secure than Argon2id.

( ) Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 are all common iterated per-user salted cryptographic hash algorithms; among those three, prefer Argon2id unless you have a reason to do otherwise.

# Answer

Select the true statement(s):

(!) You can eliminate all authentication security and privacy concerns by delegating authentication to another service.
- Not so. For one thing, can you trust that other service? That other service will know who authenticated when; is that acceptable? In many cases it is a good decision to delegate, but you need to consider the ramifications.

( ) A secure way for a server to store passwords for inbound authentication is to hash the password using SHA-1.
- Absolutely not, that is an *insecure* approach. You should use an algorithm specifically designed for this purpose, such as Argon2id.

( ) PBKDF2 is more secure than Argon2id.
- No, that is the wrong way around. Argon2id has a much stronger resistance to hardware-based attacks than PBKDF2.

(x) Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 are all common iterated per-user salted cryptographic hash algorithms; among those three, prefer Argon2id unless you have a reason to do otherwise.
