# Answer

In C and C++, a null pointer dereference is not a serious security problem, because you will just read a data value or, at worst, crash the program. True or False?

( ) True
(x) False

## Explanation

No, in C and C++ a null pointer dereference is undefined behavior. Any undefined behavior could cause anything bad to happen, including erasing all files, displaying all secret keys, or anything else. It is more likely to cause a subtle problem, but that subtle problem could also be a serious security vulnerability.
