# Answer

If an untrusted user connects into your system over a network, and a request fails, you should provide them with a detailed stack trace. True or False?

( ) True
(x) False

## Explanation

We hope this was a really easy one. The problem is not just that this is a terrible user experience; it could also lead to a security breach. Untrusted users should normally be told if some request failed, but there is no reason they must see all that detail; that is what logs are for.
