# Answer

Which of the following matches only “1 or more lowercase Latin letters” using an extended regular expression (given the POSIX locale)?

(!) **[a-z]&#42;**

( ) **[a-z]+**

( ) **^[a-z]&#42;$**

Remember, **^...$** are required to make this an allowlist (the text *must* match the pattern), and “**+**” means *“one or more”*.
