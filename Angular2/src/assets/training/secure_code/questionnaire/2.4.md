# Question

A server sends some React-based JavaScript to a web browser. A developer wants to include some security checks of the input in the client-side (browser-side) React code, and says that the server can trust those security checks because the server sent the client-side React code in the first place. Which of the following is true?

( ) The server *can* trust the client-side security checks in this case.

( ) The server *cannot* trust the client-side security checks in this case

# Answer

A server sends some React-based JavaScript to a web browser. A developer wants to include some security checks of the input in the client-side (browser-side) React code, and says that the server can trust those security checks because the server sent the client-side React code in the first place. Which of the following is true?

( ) The server *can* trust the client-side security checks in this case.

(x) The server *cannot* trust the client-side security checks in this case

## Explanation

The server cannot check client-side security checks in general, including in this case. The server may send React-based JavaScript to a web browser, but the *attacker* controls the web browser. That means the attacker can change the code run after it is received, or simply modify the answers the code would send back to the server. Note that this is not specific to React, it would be true for *any* client-side codeâ€¦ we are just using React as a common example.  A system generally cannot trust another system that is under the potential control of an attacker.
