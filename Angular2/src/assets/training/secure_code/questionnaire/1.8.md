# Answer

Choose the true statement.

(!) All publicly-known vulnerabilities are assigned CVE IDs. 
- No, someone has to request a CVE ID. In addition, CVEs are only granted for software that has been publicly released (including pre-releases if they are widely used). CVEs are generally not assigned to custom-built software that is not distributed. They are also not normally assigned to online services.

( ) All CVEs are assigned by the MITRE Corporation. 
- No, CVEs are assigned by a “CVE Numbering Authority” (CNA.)

(x) Avoiding common kinds of vulnerabilities is not enough by itself to make software secure, but it can be a significant help.
