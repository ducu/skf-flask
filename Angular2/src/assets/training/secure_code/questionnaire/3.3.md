# Answer

Reused software is so dangerous that you should always prefer to rewrite that software yourself when you can. True or False?

( ) True
(x) False

## Explanation

This is false. Sure, there are risks when reusing software, but there are risks in writing software yourself. It is likely that you will make mistakes as well, and those who wrote the reusable software have often spent years developing expertise in that specific area. Instead of trying to rewrite everything - which would be economically impractical - you should approach reusing software as a risk management problem. You should examine your choices, including using the tips here, to make reasoned decisions.
