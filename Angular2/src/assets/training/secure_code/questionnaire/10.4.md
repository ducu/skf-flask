# Question

Select the true statement(s):

( ) In many programming languages, a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator will have “secure” or “crypto” in its name.

( ) In many programming languages, a function/method with the name “random” but no other indicator is typically a predictable random number and should not be used for security.

( ) It is easy to tell if a cryptographic PRNG is subverted.
