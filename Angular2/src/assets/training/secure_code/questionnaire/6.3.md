# Answer

Avoid unnecessarily calling an operating system shell when you simply want to run another program. True or False?

(x) True
( ) False

## Explanation

This is true. Not only is it more efficient, but the operating system shell usually responds to a large number of special characters that you would need to deal with to use it securely. If you donâ€™t need its additional functions, there is no point in calling through it. Of course, there may be cases where its additional capabilities are valuable to you; in those cases, you will need to be very careful and escape metacharacters to ensure that data is not misinterpreted.
