# Answer

It is fine to support a redirector URL, e.g., **https://bank.example.com/redirect?url=https://dangerous.example.com**, as long as the URL is carefully sanitized to only allow trusted URLs. True or False?

(x) True
( ) False

## Explanation

This is true! The problem is not redirection, it is *unvalidated* redirection. Of course, if you donâ€™t allow redirection at all, that is even safer, but at the very least it is important to validate the redirection to ensure that it is a value you expect.
