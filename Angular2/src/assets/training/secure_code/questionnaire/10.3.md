# Question

Select the true statement(s):

( ) RSA with a 1024-bit key is generally considered adequately secure for most use cases.

( ) RSA is basically exponentiation, so to limit dependencies it is often better to reimplement it within a larger system.

( ) Curve25519 is a widely-used algorithm that is generally considered secure.
