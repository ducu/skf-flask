# Answer

Do not waste space telling a receiving web browser the data type or encoding being sent, as browsers do an excellent job at automatically determining this information. True or False?

( ) True
(x) False

## Explanation

This is false. Web browsers do an excellent job at automatically determining this information when there is no attack, but attackers can be very crafty at supplying data specifically designed to fool receiving programsâ€™ heuristics. Instead, where options exist, you should send information to recipients to tell them exactly how to interpret the data, such as its data type and encoding.
