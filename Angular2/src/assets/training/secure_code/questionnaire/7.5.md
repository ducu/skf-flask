# Answer

When a user logs in again, reuse the session id if session ids are used and already present, to reduce confusion to the user. True or False?

( ) True
(x) False

## Explanation

This is false. If a user is logging in again, they are asking for a new session. Honor that request by creating a new session!

Reusing an existing session can, in some implementations, open a system to an attack called session fixation. We have not gone into the details of session fixation in this course, but that is because the countermeasure (“don’t reuse session ids”) is much easier to explain than the attack.
