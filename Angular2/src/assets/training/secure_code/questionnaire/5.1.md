# Answer

( ) True
(x) False

## Explanation

Absolutely not. A potential attacker has sent an email address, and so the only thing you can be sure of is that someone sent that email address. If the reset is for a particular account, only an email to an address *known* to apply to that account (from the database) should be used, because in general we prefer to use (more) trusted data.

Password resets using just email are not a strong authentication mechanism to start with. But it is a common enough circumstance, and it is useful as a simple example.
