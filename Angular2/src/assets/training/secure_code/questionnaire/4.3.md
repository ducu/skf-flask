# Answer


In Unicode a character is represented by a 16-bit value. True or False?

( ) True
(x) False

## Explanation

There are simply too many characters to encode them all in 16 bits, so Unicode now uses 21 bits to encode characters. Many languages and APIs use 16-bit “character” values, but if they are to represent all Unicode characters, sometimes these characters are only *part* of an actual character.
