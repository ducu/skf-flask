# Answer

Secret keys should be stored in source code so that they cannot be easily read, as they could be if they were stored in separate files. True or False?

( ) True
(x) False

## Explanation

No, quite the opposite. Donâ€™t store secret keys in source code! Source code is often shared with many others, and is stored in version control systems (making it more accessible to others). Another reason to store secret keys separately is so they can be easily changed. If an attacker reads the secret keys, then just change the keys.
