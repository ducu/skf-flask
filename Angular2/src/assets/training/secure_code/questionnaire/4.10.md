# Answer

For ease of use, you should deliver applications with a standard known password and make it clear in the documentation how to change that password. True or False?

( ) True
(x) False

## Explanation

Absolutely not. If there is a standard known password, it will be immediately posted on the World Wide Web, and all attackers will use that password when trying to attack those systems. Many users will not read documentation. For an application to be secure, it needs to be “secure by default"; an application with a known preset password is *insecure* by default. One alternative would be to have a “please create your password” prompt when the application is first used.
