Select the true statement(s):

(!) If you are invoking a TLS library, it is reasonable to assume that it fully verifies the server’s TLS certificate automatically.
- Not so. Many libraries do *not* fully verify it, e.g., they might not verify that the certificate is appropriate for a given system. Some do, but when using a TLS library you have not used before, it is important to check what it verifies.

(x) Web browsers use TLS or SSL when connecting to an external site with an “**https:**” URL.

(x) When web browsers contact a server with TLS, they use a configurable set of certificate authority public keys (either included with the browser or provided via the operating system).

(x) Recommended HTTPS server settings can be found at Mozilla’s “Security/Server Side TLS” site.
