# Answer

Just pick secure software to reuse, and your application will be secure. True or False?

( ) True
(x) False

## Explanation

This is false. Clearly, if you pick known *insecure* software, you will have a problem. In addition, you should prefer software thatâ€™s easier to use securely. But in general, you need to *use* reused software in a secure way - not just pick secure components.
