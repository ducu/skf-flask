# Question

Select the true statement(s) about fuzzing:

( ) Fuzzers send input to a program and determine if the output is correct.

( ) A coverage-guided or feedback-based fuzzer uses information about what code is covered by past input executions to determine what inputs to generate next.

( ) When fuzzing a component written in C or C++, it can be helpful to enable sanitizers such as address sanitizer (ASAN) to turn internal state problems into a crash that the fuzzer can detect.

( ) Fuzzing typically requires extra steps to apply to code that processes inputs with a checksum validation.

( ) Typically, fuzzing finds new vulnerabilities as a steady state over time.

# Answer

Select the true statement(s) about fuzzing:

(!) Fuzzers send input to a program and determine if the output is correct.

(x) A coverage-guided or feedback-based fuzzer uses information about what code is covered by past input executions to determine what inputs to generate next.

(x) When fuzzing a component written in C or C++, it can be helpful to enable sanitizers such as address sanitizer (ASAN) to turn internal state problems into a crash that the fuzzer can detect.

(x) Fuzzing typically requires extra steps to apply to code that processes inputs with a checksum validation.

( ) Typically, fuzzing finds new vulnerabilities as a steady state over time.
- No, typically there is a diminishing rate of return.
