# Answer

Choosing a framework or library that automatically escapes HTML output is often one of the best ways to counter XSS attacks. True or False?

(x) True
( ) False

## Explanation

This is true. Many web applications generate many fragments of HTML, and it is impractical to remember to manually escape every one of them. Instead, use a system that automatically escapes them. In some cases, you will need to override this, but these overrides can be carefully reviewed on each use to ensure that they are secure.

Of course, other measures can help as well, but having secure *programming* defaults means that there are usually fewer problems in the first place.
