# Answer

Using a CSP setting that forbids inline scripts, requires that JavaScript only be executed from specific trusted locations, and moving all JavaScript to separate files into those locations can reduce the impact of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. True or False?

(x) True
( ) False

## Explanation

This is true. CSP does not eliminate all problems, but CSP does let you forbid inline scripts and instead require JavaScript to be loaded from specific trusted locations. In this configuration, XSS attacks can no longer easily insert malicious JavaScript code, and that can reduce the impact of XSS attacks.
