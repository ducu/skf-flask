# Answer

In general, you should validate inputs from untrusted users by:

(!) Rejecting patterns that are known to be malicious.

(x) Identifying a strict pattern of what is permitted and rejecting any input that does not meet it.

## Explanation

In general, you should use *allowlisting*, not *denylisting*. Attackers can always come up with another attack, so trying to come up with a list of “everything that should be denied” is a never-ending task. It is generally better to narrowly determine what should be allowed, and then reject everything else.
