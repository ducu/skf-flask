Which of the followings are charasteristics of incubated vulnerability?
	
* ( ) The attack vector needs to be persisted, it needs to be stored in the persistence layer, and this would only occur if weak data validation was present or the data arrived into the system via another channel such as an admin console or directly via a backend batch process.
* ( ) Once the attack vector was "recalled" the vector would need to be executed successfully. For example, an incubated XSS attack would require weak output validation so the script would be delivered to the client in its executable form.
* ( ) None of the above

# Question

Which of the following scenarios are an example of a incubated vulnerability?
	
* ( ) Upload a file that will exploit a component in the local user workstation when viewed or downloaded by the user.
* ( ) Some web servers present an administration interface that may allow an attacker to upload active components of her choice to the site. A WAR file can be uploaded and a new web application deployed at the site, which will not only allow the pen tester to execute code of her choice locally at the server, but also to plant an application at the trusted site, which the site regular users can then access
* ( ) None of the above
