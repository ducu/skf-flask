# Question

Which of the followings malicious actions can be performend as a consequence of session puzzling? Can choose multiple answers.

* ( ) Bypass efficient authentication enforcement mechanisms, and impersonate legitimate users
* ( ) Elevate the privileges of a malicious user account, in an environment that would otherwise be considered foolproof.
* ( ) Skip over qualifying phases in multi-phase processes, even if the process includes all the commonly recommended code level restrictions.
* ( ) Manipulate server-side values in indirect methods that cannot be predicted or detected.
* ( ) Execute traditional attacks in locations that were previously unreachable, or even considered secure.
* ( ) None of the above
