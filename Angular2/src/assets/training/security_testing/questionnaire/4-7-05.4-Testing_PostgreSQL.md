# Answer

* ( ) Retrieve values from table named pg_read_file
* ( ) The file fully will be retrieved if it is larger than 1000 bytes.
* (x) It will retrieve at most 1000 bytes of the server.key file.
* ( ) None of the above

Explanation: pg_read_file returns part of a text file, starting at the given offset, returning at most length bytes (less if the end of file is reached first). If offset is negative, it is relative to the end of the file. If offset and length are omitted, the entire file is returned.
