# Answer

* (x) True
* ( ) False

Explanation: an organization may have a single webserver on their internal network, which hosts both their public website (on www.example.org) and their internal Intranet (on intranet.example.org, but that record only exists on the internal DNS server). Although it would not be possible to browse directly to intranet.example.org from outside the network (as the domain would not resolve), it may be possible to access to Intranet by making a request from outside with the following Host header:

Host: intranet.example.org

This could also be achieved by adding an entry for intranet.example.org to your hosts file with the public IP address of www.example.org, or by overriding DNS resolution in the testing tool.
