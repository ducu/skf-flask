# Question

Decide if the given statmen is true or false.

"A threat is a flaw or weakness in a system's design, implementation, operation or management that could be exploited to compromise the system's security objectives."

* ( ) True
* ( ) False

# Answer

* ( ) True
* (x) False

Explanation: A threat is anything (a malicious external attacker, an internal user, a system instability, etc) that may harm the assets owned by an application (resources of value, such as the data in a database or in the file system) by exploiting a vulnerability.

# Answer

* ( ) Checks for default and simple passwords.
* (x) Checks the behavior of the software by just observation and monitoring.
* ( ) Checks if a standart user can access to administrative pages.
* ( ) Checks if API allows to make request without authentication.

Explanation: During passive testing, a tester tries to understand the application's logic and explores the application as a user. Tools can be used for information gathering. For example, an HTTP proxy can be used to observe all the HTTP requests and responses. At the end of this phase, the tester should generally understand all the access points and functionality of the system (e.g., HTTP headers, parameters, cookies, APIs, technology usage/patterns, etc).
