# Answer

* ( ) True
* (x) False


Explanation: Penetration testing is generally inefficient at finding bugs and relies excessively on the skill of the tester. It should only be considered as an implementation technique, or to raise awareness of production issues. To improve the security of applications, the security quality of the software must be improved. That means testing security during the definition, design, development, deployment, and maintenance stages, and not relying on the costly strategy of waiting until code is completely built.
