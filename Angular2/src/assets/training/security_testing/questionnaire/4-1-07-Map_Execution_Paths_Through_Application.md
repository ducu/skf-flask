# Question

Which of the followings can be used as an approach for testing and measurement code coverage ? Can choose multiple answers.

* ( ) Test each of the paths through an application that includes combinatorial and boundary value analysis testing for each decision path. While this approach offers thoroughness, the number of testable paths grows exponentially with each decision branch.
* ( ) Tests the assignment of variables via external interaction (normally users). Focuses on mapping the flow, transformation and use of data throughout an application.
* ( ) Tests multiple concurrent instances of the application manipulating the same data.
* ( ) None of the above 

-----SPLIT-----
